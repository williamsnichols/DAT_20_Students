# Short Introduction to Franklyn Camejo #

Hello my name is Franklyn Camejo. I am a Director of IT at a Legal Outsourcing firm called Integreon. 

My responsibilities include:
 * Managing the day-to-day IT operations for all the Integreon U.S.-based offices
 * Managing local and global IT projects
 * Acting as liaison to various business units in the organization
 * Managing a staff of six engineers. 

Integreon has started using analytics prodcuts within the __*eDiscovery*__ business to reduce the the number of documents an attorneys have to reviewing in finding responsive docuemnts. This will in turn significanlty save our clients money in attorney hourly fees.

I like to work with text data and financial derivatives data for high probability investing.

I signed up for Data Science course at GA to learn more about the industry and develop my skill set for a job in Dtaa Science.

A very interesting article in Harvard Business Review
