# Project review for Calista

## Strengths of this project 
  - clear visualizations illustrate breakdown of various features/frequencies
  - visualizations are well-labeled
## Comments about things you think could be improved
  - initial questions / queries not fully addressed
  - may have been easier to focus instead on a simiple binary target -- consumer disputed yes/no -- instead of on the nature of the complaint by way of the text strings.
## Questions about things you don't understand
  - while you didn't quite answer the questions you set out to answer, do you have any initial guesses as to the relationship between zip codes and complaints?
## Comments about their code
  - code is clear and concise! 
## Suggestions for next steps
  - take it one step further and answer the initial questions
